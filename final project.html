          <h2>Planning, Brain Storming</h2>
               <p> Our final project is to be an individual project (due to COVID-19) which has to contain      elements of what we have learnt throughout the term. Hence it needs to have parts that are 3D printed, Laser cut as well as embeded programming (Arduino). <br>
                
             As I am still very much a beginner, I want do a simple project that would be meaningful to me as something I would look back and tell myself that "Yes I did that".<br> 
                
             I decided to go more of a decorative piece compared to a technical piece. <br>  
                
             My idea is to makea colour changing lamp with photos surrounding it
                
            </p>
            
               <p> I found out about <b>Lithophane Pictures</b> which could be done using a 3D printer and found that it was a really interesting way to process photographs. Essentially using different thickness which will allow different amount of light to pass through forming a photo. Hence my 3D printed aspect for my project will be lithophane.</p>
                   
               <p>As for the lamp, I would use the Arduino and programme it to either 1. Change with temperature or 2. change on a constant timing. If possible, I would like to connect the board to a battery power source instead of USB so that the whole piece is able to be portable or used in a remote location.</p>
                   
               <p>For Laser Cutting, I decided that the casing of the piece will be done using the laser cutter as it would take lesser time comapred to a 3D printer. Using the laser cutter will also allow me to engrave designs and words on the surface. The cubes will be done individually and joined together like a jig-saw piece.</p>
           
           <p>Upon further thinking, the size of the bigger box (led lamp) has to be at least 10cm wide, smallest possible length. </p>

           <p>Upon further thinking, I have concluded and gotten approval for the lamp project. To simplify, instead of doing 6 six boxes excluding the main box, I will scale down the project and only do 2 side boxes. </p>
           
            <p>As suggested by Mr Chew, I will programme the LED to change colour with press of button, so the lamp will light up to a few different colours (can include random/fade) before turning off. Instead of using a USB connection, I will be using the battery for this project as to make the structure portable.</p>
           
            <p>Instead of using the breadboard, I will solder the components directly connected to the Arduino to minimise the size of the structure.

           <h2>Bill of Materials</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>white PLA for 3D printing</li>
               <li>wood sheet for laser cutting</li>
               <li>RGB LED- 3</li>
               <Li>Ardunino Uno (no need bread board, solder electrical components directly</Li>
               <li>connecting cables for Arduino</li>
               <li>batter connecter thing for Arduino (I dont know the name for this)</li>
               <li>button/switch - 1</li>
           </ul>
           
           <h2>CAD drawings</h2>
           <h1>Main box</h1>
           <img alt="CAD 1 main cube" src="Images/CAD1.png" height="400">
           <p>For the first draft, the cube is 60x60x60mm. Size will change depending on the clarity of the printed lithophanes. The holes at the top and side is placed for the RGB LED to go through. The small box will be used as a joint and a connecting pin will be cut out to join the two cubes together.<br>
               There are small groves at the front edge of the cube, that is to allow the lithophane some area to fit in (like a holder). I intend on engraving it in with the laser cutter. <br>
               Once the size of the whole structure is finalised and if time permits, I would like to engrave some designs on the side on the cube
