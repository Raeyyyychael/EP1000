           <p>We had to create our own personal website from scratch! Having no background on everything that we are going to do (for the entire module actually) I found it really interesting and quite challenging to pick up this new skill</p>
           
           <p>We were thought how to programe HTML for our basic website as well as include CSS to make it look nicer. Once we were done with the website, we had to upload it onto Github.io as a repository </p>
           
           <p>Initially, it was really difficult for me to understand how to do up a website. However, there were video tutorials guiding me step by step to create the website. The videos were really helpful and now i am able to make my own page as to how I like it to be.</p>
