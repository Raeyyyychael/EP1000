        <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
           
           <p>We had to create our own personal website from scratch! Having no background on everything that we are going to do (for the entire module actually) I found it really interesting and quite challenging to pick up this new skill</p>
           
           <p>We were thought how to programe HTML for our basic website as well as include CSS to make it look nicer. Once we were done with the website, we had to upload it onto Github.io as a repository </p>
           
           <p>Initially, it was really difficult for me to understand how to do up a website. However, there were video tutorials guiding me step by step to create the website. The videos were really helpful and now i am able to make my own page as to how I like it to be.</p>
           
           <p>For my webpage, I decided to do with only HTML and CSS as this is my first time designing a wedpage and would get confused if more elements were added.</p>
           
           <p>Some useful commands I have learnt in HTML <br>
           <b>ul</b> is used for an unordered list <br>
           <b>ol</b> is used for an ordered list (with numbers) <br>
           <b>P</b>is used when starting new paragraphs <br>
           <b>img</b> is used when including images <br> 
           <b>h</b> is used to include headings<br></p>
               <ul>
       <li> A useful website I used was W3schools.com where it had step by stap instructions as well as tutorials for us to learn the different commands for both HTML as well as CSS.</li>
           </ul>

        <h2>Brackets</h2>
           <p>Often, when doing my webpage, I will split screen, one side having Brackets while the other is W3 schools which serves as my guide when writing my document</p>
