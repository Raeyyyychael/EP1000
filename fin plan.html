            <h2>Brain Storming</h2>
            <p> Our final project is to be an individual project (due to COVID-19) which has to contain      elements of what we have learnt throughout the term. Hence it needs to have parts that are 3D printed, Laser cut as well as embeded programming (Arduino). <br>
                
             As I am still very much a beginner, I want do a simple project that would be meaningful to me as something I would look back and tell myself that "Yes I did that".<br> 
                
             I decided to go more of a decorative piece compared to a technical piece. <br>  
                
             My idea is to makea colour changing lamp with photos surrounding it
                
            </p>
            
               <p> I found out about <b>Lithophane Pictures</b> which could be done using a 3D printer and found that it was a really interesting way to process photographs. Essentially using different thickness which will allow different amount of light to pass through forming a photo. Hence my 3D printed aspect for my project will be lithophane.</p>
                   
               <p>As for the lamp, I would use the Arduino and programme it to either 1. Change with temperature or 2. change on a constant timing. If possible, I would like to connect the board to a battery power source instead of USB so that the whole piece is able to be portable or used in a remote location.</p>
                   
               <p>For Laser Cutting, I decided that the casing of the piece will be done using the laser cutter as it would take lesser time comapred to a 3D printer. Using the laser cutter will also allow me to engrave designs and words on the surface. The cubes will be done individually and joined together like a jig-saw piece.</p>
